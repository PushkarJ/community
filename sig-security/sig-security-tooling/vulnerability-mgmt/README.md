# Vulnerability Management
Covers kubernetes wide vulnerability management process, policies and workflows 
that tackle known vulnerabilities in kubernetes artifacts

## Goals

1. Identify known vulnerabilities in kubernetes artifacts by scanning them periodically
2. Leverage the existing triage and resolution process (i.e. Github issues, PRs) 
   to document and resolve any vulnerabilities that impact kubernetes
3. Create community driven awareness and documentation around known 
   CVEs in kubernetes related artifacts
   
### Build Time Dependencies

A tool agnostic periodic scanning of build time dependencies 
(typically dependencies found in `go.mod` file) of kubernetes. 
More details can be found [here](build-time-dependencies.md)

### Vulnerability Resolution Policy

Leveraging community driven triage and impact assessment to resolve known 
vulnerabilities in kubernetes artifacts. More details can be found [here](policy-for-vulnerability-resolution.md)

*NOTE*: Artifacts here refer to code, images and binaries

## Non-Goals

1. **Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities**: This will continue to be the
   responsibility
   of [Product Security Committee / Security Response Committee](../../../committee-product-security/README.md)
2. **Runtime dependencies**: Triaging of vulnerabilities found in components
   that are runtime dependencies for an on-premises or _*
   -as-a-service_
   kubernetes deployment. Examples include but are not limited to container
   runtimes, container registries, Node OS
3. **Resolving license violations**: Allowed third party license policy can be
   found here:
   https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#approved-licenses-for-allowlist

## Upcoming work

Although, more items will be added through community feedback and organic growth of
security needs of the project, currently identified work includes automating 
triage and resolution of vulnerabilities as it relates to container 
images in kubernetes repo

### Container Images

The effort is beginning to take form and is being
tracked [Issue #1833](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/1833)
